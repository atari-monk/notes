Refactor TopLeftCollisionDetector to use interface IStartable, same as CenterCollisionDetector  \n3. Rename interface ICollisionInfo to ICollision  \n4. Rename file ICollisionInfo to ICollision  \n5. Move file ICollisionEntity to collision folder  \n6. Modiffy ICollisionDetector, use ICollision in it, turned out it's not used currently  \n\nRefactoring, 3 pomodoros (1.5 standing):  \n\n1. Modiffy CollisionDetector to use ICollision  \n2. Refactor lib exports  \n3. Better names in ICollisionHandler  \n4. Rename in ICollisionHandler classes  \n5. Use ICollision in detector, new CenterCollision class  \n6. ICollision in systems  \n\nTutorial, 2 pomodoros:  \n\n1. Duplicating platforms to form level  \n2. Coding player movement controller  \n3. Removing friction, jumping only from ground (not in air)  \n\nRefactoring, 3 pomodoros:  \n\n1. New interface ICollisionAlgorithm  \n2. Implemented in both algorithms for center and top left point collision  \n3. In top left point collision vectors used in data",
